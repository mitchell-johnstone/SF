# Space Cowboy (Working title)

Overall idea: 
Cowboy (maybe robot?) 
Pistols
Ruthlessly determined

Wait, could I do the other pov? 
POV of the thief
capable of constructing mirrors that become reality?
or maybe localized time loops? Rip out chunk of the past to paste in the current
Tries (succeeds) at stealing from a bank

Oh, where else to begin... except the end of course. The end of a barrel, pointed directly at my head. I don't see the man holding it, although I've witnessed his entire life.
He doesn't need to pull the trigger; he's shown how weak I am, how futile my entire life up to this point has been.
He does anyway.

The bullet leaves the pistol fast, although I see it crawl. I'm exhaling across a microsecond that feels like a millenia (being 15, I'll never have the chance to see if that's true).
The trajectory is dead on. There's nothing left for me. Soon, there'll be nothing left of me.

Time has a sick sense of humor. 

Temporary pain is bearable. But that requires it to pass. This? This is eternity. It won't let me go. I've died to this man, this pistol, this gun, over and over. And everytime that gun goes off, I must watch, knowing this will be my last breath.
I feel every tear of muscle and bone as the projectile screams through my skull. 
I am forced to experience the pain that is heightened one thousand times, extended a million times, repeated forever.

Only after I've trudged through infinity with pain as my only existence, does Time pull me back.
The snap goes back to just after I had killed the girl behind the counter.
She had done everything I commanded, obediant and afraid as she was (was it the gun or the mask that scared her more?).
But at that point, she was useless.

I grimace at my naivety, being both a second, many years, and lifetimes away from who I once was in that moment. My hands draw up quickly in readiness to the bullets that come quickly.

"Why?" I ask, although I've heard the unending, unwavering answer. I just want it to change. "I could've given it all to you."
His eyes meet mine, and whisper, just loud enough for me to hear: "You're irrelevant. Your only usefulness is that, as a crimal, I can legally shoot you."

The cost of living forever isn't losing those you love: it's watching history repeat itself through the lens of knowing futility.
