# SF
I really enjoy reading Sci-Fi stories, and I enjoy coming up with ideas of my own for stories, so I'd like to try my hand at writing.
The first few might be rough, but that is to be expected. I won't get it the first try, but I'll try to keep trying.

So, if I can, I'll try writing every week. Something. Anything. As long as it stretches my thinking, my writing, my determination.
