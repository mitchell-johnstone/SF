# Chapter 1

Eamg was murmering the names of constellations in his sleep again, perfectly ordered from north to south, east to west. While Fethi had grown accustomed to the rote recall of the constant sky, Fethi preffered to meander the stars, not just study it. There were many that vied for her attention, but she graced only a few each night undividedly. Before she slept, she would let her eyes wander until one sparkled just for her, and she would detail the origination of that bead of light. She would repeat this until she had closed her eyes; only then did the stars finally hide from her view.

Tonight, and a few nights before, Eamg had assumed the role of orator, but could and did perform in his sleep. It became a drone that would interrupt Fethi's ritual and tuck her in before she could even remember one detail. She worried the stars felt unloved without her presence.

Fethi had asked him nicely to keep quiet about the stars at night, and as Eamg curled into a feeble huddle on the ground as he did every night, he had replaced the stars' names with words of an ancient tongue that deeply troubled her and made the ground shake by a barely perceptible margin. After that she decided her safety was worth more than her sanity, and Eamg went back to methodically trace the sky's novelties.

That had been two sleeps ago. Every day, the hand on Fethi's watch had dragged past each of the 8 ticks with her eyes daring it to stop or to provide some evidence of its worth. It marched on uselessly. Every hour, she thought about smashing it to bits. But it reflected the stars so delicately.

Instead, she went out to hunt. There was a bit of game, but they were always so hard to see without light and hard to keep still when shown, so it was tough. Out of the 6 meals they've had, only 2 had rabbit meat to support them.

She didn't want to hear any more about the stars, and the hunts were too difficult here, so she kicked Eagm's leg. Her touch was gentle enough to have been wildlife, which woke him and provided her with an alibi that by now had grown transparent.

Fethi feigned innocence, "Awww, I was rather enjoying you describe the benevolent acts of Shniel."

Eagm blinked the sleep away, then blinked away the dazed look from re-realizing that his hands were still bound behind him and in such a way as to keep his fingers spread. "He always seemed more bastardly," He yawned, "than benevolent."

"Bastardly?" Fethi asked incredulously. "Ah, so how one grows up dictates one's actions? One's motivations? He couldn't help that he was born of the king but not in his house."

"And as such, he should know the nobility as well as the peasants. It's in his blood. His very soul." By now he had struggled against gravity's hold enough to right himself, his fingertips brushing the grass and dirt. "A man of his nature should not stoop to such lows."



"His soul is only remembered though and placed up among the others
"


"Kind deeds, you say? Tell me, kindest of souls, how you came to be tied up and brought in?






"Why does he get to set the time and date?"

"Because he has the coin."

"Fine, yes, but how dare he show up late?"

"Because he has the coin."

After sleepless nights and meals with no meat, after staring at stars and wishing she could be among them instead, she finally heard the hooves of a horse galloping their way.






TLDR: You can take one, too, if only you tried.
