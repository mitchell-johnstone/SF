# Characters:
I really like using scrambled nouns for character names:
- Farrem: Farmer
    The Stoic, Nihilistic one. Calm and unmoveable.
    Only cares about his crops.
    his child's ashes are in the dirt? He spread them there so he could hold her every day. His wife left, she couldn't stand the see how he looked like his young child when he came back from work.

- Risque: Squire
    A man wanting and pretending to be a knight.
    Who can he protect? Who has he protected? Who will he vanquish?
    His duty is to bring in debts. The moon taking the sky is the biggest debt owed to humanity.

- Eamg: Mage (?)
    A "dark" mage. His ability is to fabricate things in the darkness. As long as no one sees them, he can use it. The unseen Green Lantern.
    Motivated to create ever more convincing things. But always wanted to see what he made. Actually creative? Wants light to see his creations.

- Fethi: Thief
    The charmer. She can take anything while distracting you with her flirts. Really likes the light. Wants to steal the stars.
