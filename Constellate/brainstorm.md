## The world
the world is the inside of a ball. 
There used to be both light and dark, but the light was simply the sky and the dark was the depths of the ocean. The people would rejoice in the sun and fear the sea.
Eventually, the darkness in the sea crept up the horizon and into the sky. It covered up the sun. It pushed out all the light. The darkness blanketted entirely - well, almost. To ensure the darkness was kept in place, spikes were set up to pin it in place. 

The sides:
- The sun, with it's brightness, was the sole being of light.
- The dark, lead from the depths by the moon hidden away.

The sun has suffused light into people as it glowed, but no one noticed, since it was always bright out.
Once it grew dark, the people who were lit were hunted and gathered by the moon to serve as stars.


Now, the world is one big panopticon: Those stars above look below, and soldiers are within shadows.


## Interludes (short stories to build the world):

### The Drowned Sun
The moon was always thought of as a reflection of the sun, deep deep down.

### The Star Stealer
Where the sky meets the sea is a bridge, so far off as to be impossible to ascend in any normal human's lifetime. But the other beings can pass between the two so fluidly it was as if there had never been a difference.
A boy and his brother sit on the pier, and the older one tells the smaller of the bridge. As the smaller goes forward to look, the bigger pushed him in, laughing. The boy swims up, yells at his brother, but is pulled away, fast, sharp.

The young boy had a star inside of him. He had gotten it from the joy of his childhood with his brother and family, and basking endless hours in the sun. It just wasn't visible yet... It was strong enough to hold down the dark sky

There was only a few stars at first, here only 3. Soon hundreds.

### The Half Eclipse
Eventually in the war between the sun and the sea, a balance was struck. The moon had arrisen to meet the sun head on.
And the people, as they looked up, saw half of each, and thought it was over. They had grown to appreciate a bit of dark with their everlasting light. But the moon would not be given mere morsels.

### The Spike Tender
A man wanders through the sky, visiting each of the spikes holding the dark in place.
Each spike is a person, gathered from the realm below. Looking up the tenderer can see the land curve and twine.
He feeds each boy, waters them, tells them stories of the land above.

### The Star Stealer (2)
A man comes about who knows how to listen. He can hear the cries from above, or the hopes and dreams. He listens intently. He knows their names, and has drawn map upon map of their whereabouts.
Then, one of the star bois come to him. He finds that the young boy can reach out to the others. The star power can be transferred! He asks the boy to go outside, and to go to the sky and bring back another. And then another. Soon the boy comes back with 4 new stars. As he goes again, he is lost, and falls, a shooting star. (the king has blasted him with such radiance as an opening in the fabric of the sky, and he cannot withstand it and falls to the ground).
