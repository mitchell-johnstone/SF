# IDK what I'm doing

## Genral Guiding Principle
Lately, more and more of my close friends have expressed their dissatisfaction with their life. Or how their life is going.
Some don't see themselves contributing to the world.
Some don't think their work is of value, not to themselves nor to their work.
Some see the stress of what they had and the lack of it they have now and see an inherent wrong in the safety and security.
Some want to feel like what they do matters.
The facade of audult life is bleeding at the seems. It's not real. A Myth, propogated from infinity. 
No one knows what their doing, and that makes it all the worse when you realize that.

I don't know how I feel about it. I'm worried about what comes next after college. What if I'm wrong? And where do I go now?
I wanted to write to try to get that feeling down. That dissatisfaction, with what I'm doing with my life and that I see around me. 
Maybe something that'd come and change that.

So I want the main character to be listless. They are a long trucker across space. 
They understand the functions of the machine they ride but lack the expertise to improve it.
They have nothing to do on their trip but think.

Then there's this man that appears in space and offers him a chance. 50/50. Easy. Enticing.
Is that a way to be more satisfied? What would it take?
Should I accept such a risk?

## Motivations

War made him this way
- raised utilitarian
	- war is everything, the driving force of civ
- Battalions under his fingertips
- He was part of an advaced civilization
	- They fought on the opponents level
		- Researched into their tech, used their weapons
	- Thus, he fought through logic, through mind speak, over metal.
- He was a mid-level commander
	- when he conquered his sector, he was told to just maintain it
	- He realizes it's useless
		- Regardless of if they're in the space or the original occupants, it's just life
- Then another life force comes in and destroys everything
	- He realizes that he's still a lesser civilization by comparison
	- There are some civs that'll last millions of year, simply because people don't care
- So he becomes depressed, knowing there'll always be a bigger fish.
	- He can't grasp infinity so he get's lost in the fall
- At this point, his civ is no more. He doesn't know who is and isn't. It doesn't matter.
- Has nothing left
- except his drive to be efficient.
	- trucking job that no one else will do > killing himself
- unfulfilled either way.
	- Trucking job doesn't bring any joy.
		- Used to being busy. The work here is so slow. No stress.
	- Free time is wasted time.

## Space ship
Small.

Name: Titan's Fiasco?
      Satanic Fisto?
      Satanist Foci?

## The actual story
Lightyears flicked across the Fiasco's viewport, individual star's vibrant light coalescing to monotony. 


It was an elegant system. 

if heaven were to grant me a boon, I'd ask for this plot to be expunged from my mind.
