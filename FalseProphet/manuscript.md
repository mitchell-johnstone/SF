# The False Prophet (Working Title)

## New religion: Toboro

## Chapter 1
I wasn't the first to descend these stairs, but I was certain I'd be the last.

The cave had been unassuming from the outside, a crack in the wall just wide enough for a young boy looking for his destiny. If not for the dying star guiding me here, I wouldn't have noticed and been on my way to the King by now. The sun's rays reached through the slit, enough to see forward but not enough to understand what I walked over and towards. Only when I bent down did I feel the corpses littering the ground. 

My days in the league had taught me that traps were common in ancient times, but this must've taken decades to set up. Still, enough men had wondered in, searching for their destiny, only to have their fate be making way for the next hero. A dwarf's thick torso had wedged the swinging axe into it's groove in the wall. Leaking lighter fluid plucked off-key a bard's lute strings that were taut between his neck and dextrous fingers. After having them snapped off in a gearbox, one man's legs raised and lowered from the rest of his body in an eternal, man-made, single-action piston. The hand I held crumbled under my grasp, ashes floating downwind, and I was suddenly not wanting to breathe or stay any longer. I gave their corpses my pity, my blessing, my thanks, and my leave.

Of course, I could've turned back. The trap door to lock those unworthy in had long since been dismantled by the next great seekers. The way back would've been so much easier, so much brighter, than going deeper into the mountain's depths. But what did I have to go back for? The grave of my brother who I can never live up to? The smoldering ruins of Gentha, the village that had been under my protection? My wife and child, taken from me by His heathens? No, they would've wanted this. All of them.

I would make them proud. I would make them all proud. This was my destiny.
And now I had nothing left to lose. I strode on.

Ten paces into the hall, my foot landed on empty air.

I slammed forward into the first set of steps hard, my longsword creaking under most of my weight and digging into my skin through my heavy cloak. Momentum flipped me forward onto the landing, but my boots, slick with blood, failed to grab hold and only made me fall forward faster. My top half swung down like a catapult, launching my head directly at an edge.

I plowed into the unfortunate soul that had had the same misfortune and I, completely obliterating his body as I crashed. A broad shield on his back pressed all the air out of my lungs and rattled my head; his lungs were similarly flattened as I impacted, but acted as a helpful cushion to send me and the shield hurtling down the steps. The iron skipped and clanged against stone and bones alike, splinters skitting against the walls, each new sound clashing with the echoes, a broken, terrible sound screaming after me.

Had I tried to stear, I would've crashed; instead, those piled up against the sides naturally guided me back towards the center. I held steadfast to grooves on the side of the shield. I was going too fast to roll off without becoming another body in the piles. Grabbing onto a passing onlooker would only drag them along, or worse, stay still and tear my arm of with it. I wrapped my arms through the straps to keep me from flying off from the debris I soared across.

The light from the door had by now completely vanished as I dropped 10 flights, but as I rushed past signs hanging from the ceiling that probably told the story of this chamber and through arches of intricate beauty I had no time to admire, I could see a speck turn into a blaze of light ahead of me.

The shield-sled hit the flat stone floor, and I thanked Toboro that it didn't end in a wall. Instead, I hurtled down the center stage of a massive ballroom. I shot past thick columns, elaborate tapestry, heavy doors. The shield grasped to find purchase in the masonry, emitting in a sharp scraping that would do little to soften the jettison of noise following us. I skidded and flipped a few times before coming to a halt, staring up at the open sky.

The cacophony following me rose to a climax before dulling to a dull echo and finally an aching silence. 

Shaking, standing, slowly, I took inventory. I had a few more appendages and limbs stuck to me than I came in with. I had lost my coins and my rations, but still held onto the sword my grandfather had given unto me. Some of my footgear had worn out as it was dragged behind, and my cloak had snagged on a femur or two, but other than small cuts and massive bruising I was unharmed. Hefting it, the shield felt heavy, strong, right. 

The scroll that had told me how to find this unforgiving place had crumpled, torn from a long journey, but had served it's purpose; it knew I'd get here in the end. 

Seeing as my person was intact, I started to fill in the room I'd only seen flashing by. It was long enough to fit my entire villages in, but was nearly completely bare of any living neccessities. The floor had been prestine and decorative with artistic swirling stones, but I had come in like a novice and painting a quick ragged grey stroke, bisecting the beauty. A few scragglers had fell through the stair opening after me, but otherwise the room was empty, no living nor dead. On the other side of the room, only steps ahead of me, there was a simple statue of a metal man sitting on a throne of gold, looking aside as if even the brick walls were of more interest than anything that came down those steps. I stood epicenter a perfect circle of sunlight, even though the sun would soon set and I was well underground. The walls of the massive chasm above me were flat and brilliant, almost metallic and almost too blinding to look at as they bounced the evening light in and down, catching and directing any ray it could snatch. This was as far as the scroll had told me, but I was certain I'd figure out my fate here.

"Your fate... was to come and dissapoint me like all the others."

The voice 
"Nah, I'm just fucking with you. Fuck off."

"What would you have preferred to hear? 'Oh great hero! Your quest here has brought you far, but you still have far to go. Let me assist you on this journey.' Have you ever heard someone actually talk like that?"



"Honestly, you did better than the guy who fell through the hole. He had taken me years to fully scrape out."

"I can understand your pain, but I--"
"Oh I wish you could."
"--I need to save the rest of the land from this evil."
"The rest of this land? What about me?"


- you know what last guy said?
	- I thought we were talking about me
- He called me an afterthought
