# Rules to EMIT

READ THIS ENTIRELY - YOUR LIFE MAY DEPEND ON IT.

### EMIT
Emitting = jumping back in time to a checkpoint. 2 phases:
  - Anchor: setting a checkpoint in time
  - Emit: returning to the anchor through time

You have just done one of the above (anchor or emit). You can't recall memories; this is expected.

### Memory Loss:
Between anchoring and emitting, your brain changes due to new experiences.
Your brain at emit time differs from at anchor time, creating a collision.
Brain's response to different structures: only store general information.

### Proxy remembering:
Memori notes: device that persists your notes through iterations from emiting.

There should also be a dedicated individual with an embedded Memori Note (limited size, work in progress) trained in emit maintenence.

### Other useful notes:
- Emit panels = EP = devices that store the anchor and provide means to emits.

### Next steps:
You anchored for a reason
    - There's likely some problem you wanted to resolve.
    - Identify the problem, tackle is.
You emitted for a reason
    - Something didn't get done or you need more time.
    - Review Memori Pads to track new information from prior loops.

### Q&A
> Are the beginnings / ends always the same?

The beginning is always the same; the anchor point. The user defines the end; when the button to emit is pressed, the user returns. This means that different iterations through the loop could take different lengths.

> Is this a time loop?

It's only a loop when you Emit. Until that moment, you've just shown the intent to loop.

> Can I have multiple loops going at once?

There can be only 1 anchor per person per emit station.
So you can have multiple loops across different stations, but only 1 loop for a given station.

> Are there side effects?

Temporary nausea, disorientation, and amnesia are common.

### Warning:
The system is, in extremely rare cases, unstable. Some users drop from reality on anchoring. The anchor is still set, but the users stop existing as soon as the button is pressed. Now that you're reading this in the loop, you should be okay.
