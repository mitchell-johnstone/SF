# helpful organization

Writing is rewriting.
That means I'll have a lot of iterations, before nailing down exactly what I want.
To keep a record I start versioning my files, starting with `v1`, and keep the most recent version just the basename.
For example, if I rewrite the chapter 1, I'll have 2 files:
- `ch1.md`
- `ch1.v1.md`
