# Prologue

Two souls, intertwined eternally, spoke to each other once again.

"You've been here before."

"I know."

"You'll be here again."

"I know."

"You can't save them."

"I know."

"Then... why? Why go through all this? Why suffer and make suffer?"

"Because existence will be a better place without you in it."
