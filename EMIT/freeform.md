# Freeform

I need to work out my actual writing style, whatever that may be.
I think I have a decent style, but it's not nearly as lyrical as I'd like it to be. My allusions are too hard, my descriptions too soft. In the better books that I've read, the best lines are those general enough to have the reader experience a sort of freedom in their imagination, while descriptive enough that all reader's align to a single imagery that sets the context. I need to say a lot and a little, all at once. Part of that is the fact that I'm not using big enough words to describe the situations, because the perfect word can change a piece from good to great.

ex from the start of "This is how you lose the time war":

> When Red wins, she wins alone.
> Blood slicks her hair. She breathes out steam in the last night of this dying world.
> _That was fun_, she thinks, but the thought sours in the framing.

All of that was simple, short, not even that big word use. But the formulation of the words keeps it aligned: there's descriptions visceral yet so vague. I need to work on being general, but clearly describing, and using each word to show something, be it someone's acts, looks, familiarity with an action. Use the words to use less words.

Let's take a scene, and rewrite it over and over until the words are closer to the lyrical fashion I want.
Try to use the words:
- Ephemeron: short lived thing
- Surety: The condition of being sure, especially of oneself
- Holistic: parts of a things are interconnected and can only be understood by looking at the whole.

> Scene: They all exit the Emission room, opening up to the structure of the ship and the galaxy beyond.


## A1:
Out of the perfect blackness that consumed their view grew a snowstorm frozen mid-blizzard. As their eyes adjusted to the distance, each brilliance broke through the veil sharply, then inflamed, attracting more. The newborns cardinally mapped the extremeties of the ship, each limb an unraided tomb of information. In spiting rigidity, tension would forever steal one component from another, dining philosopher's debating the efficiency. The view of the unlimited sky was quartered, the connecting hallways obscuring emptiness. As above, so below; so fore, so behind. The holistic module was of infinite symmetrical reflection in the form of a hollow platonic octehedron.


Notes: Ok connection between cold and space, weird star metaphors. Seems overall to be too much, not having enough substance. Mostly using the fancy language to describe things more, not describing actions.

Need to use the language to show the characters, or describe the settings in a way that develops characters in some way.

## A2:
Sara reserved her hand on the Emitting panel as Maha smacked the button to open the door. The retreating baby blue revealed the eternal sky around them. Everywhere was an emptiness filled with pinpricks of space dust. Nothing moved except themselves; the ship seemed a prebound constant in spacetime, though of course they and the ship were speeding at millions of miles per hour. In line with their exit, a hallway reached all the way to another module. Then, from that module, wide halls arced away, dragging focus cardinally, orthogonally from entry and from each other, quartering Orion and all other constellations that Maha could recognize. Maha's gun lead the party down the corridor, Sara looking dubious of the thickness of the pure glass walls, and Heli staring out in awe at the infinite array of color and light from the galaxies millions of lightyears away.
































"You know, anywhere else in the galaxy, we wouldn't have this sky. Sure, it's got the same parts, but askew from ours. We're the only ones to witness the ephemeral sky."
