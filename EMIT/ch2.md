# Loop 2.0.0

> There's time enough to fail before succeeding

Three hands pressed into the emission panel; two more held Memori pens against their tablets, writing or about to be; the last absorbed a pistol's recoil as the shot enveloped the room. This has all happened before. This will happen again.

"Let's try that again," offers the bystander.

"Again?" questions the gunman. Eyes still on the victim.

A weary sigh. The bystander continues slower, picking the words purposefully, "Dejavu. Body comfortable but mind racing. You've done this before."

The gunman, stock still, stood a bit stiller. "You mean... shot someone?"

"Shot someone, looked intimidating, started an emission. All of it."

"So I've ... shot someone before. Probably few times. So I'm probably good at it. So I should be able to tell who to shoot at." Gun raises, aligned more with the shoulder-chest line ideal for stable bullet exit and entry.

"Stop tunnel-visioning on the gun." Side-eye glare. "You've stood there, that exact stance and spot, before." Shifts weight, shifts back. "Feel it in your feet against your shoes; feel how you know exactly how your shirt sleeves fall on your skin." Rolling shoulders. "You don't know why you know this. The way your breath is leaving your lung has happened time and time again. You've already lived this."

Eye's flicked between the victim and the bystander, ensuring crosshairs aligned and that the bystander hadn't come any closer. The gun lowered to point at the floor. Finger off the trigger. Safety still off. "Fine. You may just be worth a damn." He eyed the victim again, who had lowered his hands only after the gun. "But you? What's your deal?"

The victim shook his head, "Well, I woke up with you pointing a gun at me. So there's that. I'm really not a fan of having an intimite familiarity with utter terror at the moment, but I don't think I really have a choice."

The bystander interjected "Nope, no choice at all. Today is all you've got, huh?"

The gunman thought, then looked stunned at realizing his life was the sum of 2 minutes of existence, while the victim said "Happy birthday?"

"Sure. I think I'm missing notes from our last loop, because I'm missing the whole gun and shooting and insults, but the main priority now is getting you both caught up. Read this."
