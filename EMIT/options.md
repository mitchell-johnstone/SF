Tears fell onto Maha's Memori pad as he scrawled on it:

> Killing them both means we all die.

He thought _either way I'm not gonna remember this pain_ as he held a gun in one hand and picked up the EP in the other.
He thought _race to see which one of you takes me first, fuckers_ as he thumbed the safety off and flipped open the emit lid.
He thought _if the only living man shoots himself in space, does he make a -_ as metal tore through his brain and flesh depressed the button to

-- EMIT --

Maha recovered slowly from the emit, as he always has, by first focussing on his upper thight, where a past failed emit job left behind a chronic pain he takes with him in every reality. It grounded him, somehow, knowing that the pain had been there a moment ago; his temporal lighthouse.

The pain in his leg was mitigated by the gaping wound in his abdomen. The eclipsing agony brought wracking aches that rippled from his core, manifesting in a gutteral cry. He pressed his palms against the front of his side, only to feel leakage and suffering from behind. With his body paralyzed by the pain, he was stuck in a mental battle against shock. It was all the worse to go from oblivion to blinding pain.

_If I give up, I die; none of the others had medical training. Others; good. Focus. Focus on them. You can remember them. Names. Sara. Heli. Sara knows things, too many things, all the time. Heli knows less and more. Sara kept me alive. Heli gave me a gummy bear. Sara doesn't care about any of our lives. Heli skewered me._

_Okay. Okay. Okay._

_Breathe._

_Yep, that was always gonna hurt._

_Short breaths. Keep to the lungs. the lungs_


### FUTURE:
He shoots Heli, and Sara is an asshole and tries to reassert control, see Heli's death as neccessary but a symptom of his failure in his role. Heli = pawn, not person. Maha won't give up control and does not like treating Heli as Object, fights, he restarts.
He shoots Sara, and Heli stays with him to the end, but he feels guilty about the people below dying. Restart.
He tosses both the gun and the EP away, leaving fate as intended, and Heli bashes in Sara's head
