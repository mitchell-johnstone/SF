## Version 1 (WIP)

Three hands pressed into the emission docks; two more held Memori pens against their tablets, writing or about to be; the last absorbed a pistol's recoil as the shot enveloped the room. This has all happened before. This will happen again.

The grip on the gun loosens as the holder realizes the tool he has, tightens when he questions his own intentions from just a second ago. He switches to a more comfortable grip with both hands, aim still locked on the victim. Head swivels to scan behind him.

The bullet misses and embeds into wall panel. The victim's eyes snap-focus to the muzzle flare, follows as the barrel lands squarely at his chest, shuts hard in anticipation. The delay catches him off guard. Day-old sweat renewed, he opens his eyes and slowly raises his hands, and the pen clatters across the table, tip trailing black loops along the notepads.

The bystander's hands have gripped onto the edge of the console. A pained expression washes over his face. Shaking limbs reconcile years of history in moments; multiple lives flash before their eyes.

Misunderstanding eyes and disregarding ears feed uncomprehending minds until someone - finally - begins to speak.

"Great fucking shot. Next time, take out the window while you're at it." chides the bystander.
"I didn't... I..." Then, as the gunmap swivels, he decides "Fine. Probably couldn't have been worth a damn anyways".
"Wait wait WAI-".

Glass implodes.
Air floods out.
Bodies freeze.

A written note to self.
A hand slams against the panel.

## Version 2 (attempt at something new)

Transitioning back to a dimension outside of humanity's control, time flowed through the empty husks as they began to realize their conciousnesses. It took a moment to even begin; to go from emptiness complete to information overwhelming broke many a mind - even those practiced in it. It helped to focus, narrow, constrict to one fact at a time:
  - The urge and repression of a behavioral tick.
  - The ticking of a watch's third hand.
  - The handling of the cold metal gun.

Each waking mind came to the last focal point in its own fashion. The first mind regarded the object as a weapon, a way to harm and stop directed at their self. The second mind felt it's familiar form and stayed the set course, believing in a purpose unknown but obviously intended. The last and third mind marked it as irrelevent, as the gun would not - could not - change what is. All were wrong.

Only breath, time, and the final reverberations of the gunshot's echo moved throughout the room. The rest was frozen in a state of worry, confidence, or nescience. Silence blanketted and settled in, content in it's mortal expectation. After too long, it died; "How about some introductions?" ventured the ignorant.

The fearful and the controlled, each having held the other's attention prior, broke to glance at the ignorant with _Are you trying to get me killed?_ and _You first, asshole_ eyes.

"An understandable reaction. It was merely a suggestion to provoke you both into contemplating your own existence. One can't introduce oneself without knowing themself, after all. Regardless, I'll begin; I'm Sara."

The pair searched through the other's windows and found ... nothing. No depth, no recollection nor recognition, no color of understanding. They each shattered and hurt from the shards.

"How did you..." trailed off the fearful turned intrigued.

"...What the fuck did you do to me?" cried the terrified, once confident.

Sara tilted her head "I didn't do anything. You did this to yourself. See your other hand?"

He snapped attention down to find his hand placed in a groove, perfectly suited to his form. That only seemed to anger him more, finding out that his domain is unknown and uncontrolled. "I did this to myself? Really? I'm supposed to believe I willfully placed my hand here and gave up everything I could remember?"

"Yes. That's precisely what happened. Your former self submitted of his own volition."

"Submitted? You seem like an asshole and you're an unknown," the terrified said with a gun's gesture towards to the once again worried, "So no, I don't think I'll be submitting, regardless of what that other me did to get here."

"I'm not asking you to submit to anything now. I didn't even ask before, I don't think. I'm asking -"

"Wait, you didn't ask before? You just did this shit to me?" The gun swung, escalating.

"Now hold on, you're misinterpreting my -"

"Misinterpret this, fucker."

Gunshot.

Glass implodes.

Air floods out.

Bodies freeze.

Sara held tight to the panel. She noted to herself:
> Nothing terrifies confidence more than mispoken truth.

Then, as the vacuum overcame her grip, she slapped the button to
