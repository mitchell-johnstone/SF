The table in front of you is an EMIT station (EP). You've triggered a BEGIN or an EMIT by placing your hand in the contact zone and pressing the button. On BEGIN, the EP registers a point in time for all parties currently in contact with the EP. On EMIT, all parties recorded during BEGIN are brought back to the point in time registered. New triggers of BEGIN will overwrite the previous points in time, but only for the individuals that are parties of the new EMIT, as the registered point in time is recorded separately for each individual,

*Known side effects EMIT*

An individual that returns to the point in time is different that the original individual at the original moment. This causes a conflict in anatomy, so you may have discomfort and slight aches. Primarily, though, the neural pathways are in conflict, so the brain's natural response is to filter out both signals, assuming both to be invalid. This results in near total amnesia for all individuals.
