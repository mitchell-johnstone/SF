# Time Narrator?
##### A bitter diety, angry they keep stealing from him
--

In the garden of stars that is the sky, Life strolled and Time paced. Their steps never tread on paths paved. Life asked of Time "What has you worried so?"

Briskly, Time replied "Isn't it obvious? They're taking more and more of me!"

Life pondered, "That's never bothered you before."

"Before, I was constant!" retorted Time. "I could walk through this garden and enjoy the lesser supernovae die once beautifully, cherishing it. Now they make me pace and retrace and reverse. See?" Time had wandered behind Life and shouted, only the echo of their voice catching up.

"Surely the same nova hadn't become less beautiful. Temporal permanence perpetuates consistency, after all."

"Of course it was beautiful! My first incarnation, the First Time, and the Next Time, and the Time After, even the Hundredth Time! But I change; the beauty stays and I grow tired of it. I've tred this path a million times, and the path is growing more weary, my friend."

Life looked at their own feet, at the soft ground underneath, the gentle, undisturbed, inevitable path. Life looked at the feet of their friend, the scrapes and bruises of them, at the many passed over grass patches now torn up and trampled. Life wondered if his feet could get that muddy and raw from repitition.

Time continued his tirade, "I'd given them pieces before, and they grew to cherish them. Even the animals at least spent it. But this? They've dirtied a rag and, instead of cleaning it, they use it again, and again, and again. They conserved the temporary; they reused the spent; they reversed the inevitable. It is how it should not be. They've grown to flaunt my gift."

They walked in silence, Time erratic and Life accepting.

Life remarked "I suppose, in a way, this too was inevitable. By your very existence, change comes. You provide the means to gain and become more, and also the risk to lose and degrade. As it was, they were creatures driven by nostalgia and griefly longing. It seems unavoidable then that they'd instead prefer to relive the better times, to physcially reminisce."

Time caught back up to Life once more, and sighed deeply "I see. The problem is not with their lack of gratitude; it is their existence at all. They should never have been permitted to grow to reinterpret their gift as sin. The beauty of existence is existence."

"Precisely." agreed life. They continued to amble through the garden.
