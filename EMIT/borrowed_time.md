# Borrowed Time

Sara broke the silence, "Well, at a minimum, we're not dead."

They were gathered around the EMIT panel to review the notes of the past emission. Sara was sucked into a particulary vague notation on her Memori. Maha was debating between rereading the slip of paper he had, telling them all off, or finding some cheese. Heli was blank eyed, and slowly began to shiver.

"Aren't we?" Heli reached a crisis.

Sara looked up. Maha looked sideways. Sara answered "We're here talking, are we not?"

"Yes, but not the we's that we were!"

"I suppose that the re-emit does reset us from who we had become, but -"

"I had died! Before Maha had hit the button, I had already died! It can't have just taken the me from the future and plopped me down here in the past. I'd still be dead."

"A very salient point, though missing the minutia of our situation and the causes to the current effects. But still, a commendable -"

Heli raised her hands to her face, peaking out through splayed fingers, moaning "Oh god, I probably had gone to heaven. I probably went to the gates, got my judgement, hopped on the train, then got yanked back to the living world."

Sara had put down her pencil and was slowly standing "Now heli, this is an unsuitable and dangerous way of thinki-"

"I'm not real. I'm not supposed to be here. I'm supposed to be dead."

"No! You're here because the optimal resolution leads to none of us staying dead. More people means more branches means more opportunities to find a global maxima. Each life is integral, even yours. Your past you does not define the you of now."

"I'm borrowed life with borrowed time."

Maha reached Heli and reached out their hand. Heli spun and snatched Maha's gun from his belt. Maha gripped onto Heli's wrist to prevent it from raising to their head, but that left it aimed directly at Maha. They stared at each other. Heli's wrist shook. Maha stayed still.

After too long, Heli relaxed their arm and Maha took away the gun. Maha's eyes never left Heli's as he said "If you died, we all died. I need you, the one standing in front of me, so I'm not letting you kill yourself to satisfy some devine consistency."
