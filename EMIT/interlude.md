# Interlude

Sara took control over the room immediatly: "Soldier, hand over your weapon before you make me do something I won't but should regret."

Maha took his eyes off of Heli, and their glare's fought like pack animals vying for alpha superiority. One realized futility; the other took hold of the gun.

Heli took an audible breath of relief "You had me worried there for a moment, mis-"

Two quick gunshots guillotined the infant conversation. Heli and Maha's bodies dropped to the floor.

"I'm sorry, but I can't think with you two in the room".
