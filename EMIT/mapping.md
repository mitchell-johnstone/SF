# Mapping

"Do we know anything about this place other than the fact that it's huge?"

"We know the external joints and the overall likely makeup. We could likely assume it's laid in a logical, ortholinear fashion."

"Sure, it's a well planned out space. Like other place we've been through. But do you know where Engineering is?"

"Not yet. I had expected a map or indicator somewhere to help guidance, but in retrospective, the fact that Engineering is non-responsive indicates systems are down, which would be the likely source of appropriate information."

"Great. We're stuck in a maze with no help, no map, and no mythical string."

"String didn't help exploration, only backtracking, but I appreciate the allusion regardless."

"Finding which doors to go through is going to take hours, if not days. With the portable Emitter, I guess we could just keep trying? I'm not emitting again, I can't."

"While not incorrect, your proposal is inefficient and nonscalable. While current objectives necessitate a singular destination, greater context is nearly always preferable. What if we get to Engineering and we need to turn around and find Maintenance?"

"So, what, we go down one path until we can't anymore and then re-emit? Play mapmaker on the way to know where we've already been?"

"Again, close, but still unoptimal, as there's still a lot of re-treading steps already taken. The mapmaking will be integral for record keeping and session management, but instead of restarting at the beginning, we'll start at the last decision point. There's three of us, which is fairly ideal for this operation; one as the anchor, and two that facilitate alternate individual loops. You've already expressed your aversion to the EMITting process, so that leaves Maha and I as the loopers."

"Works for me." chimed in Maha.

"You understood what she's suggestion?" Heli questioned Maha.

Maha grunted "Not a bit. But she'll tell me, and I'll do it."

"Okay..." said Heli. "Wait, so you two are gonna... what?"

"Alternate loops." Heli stared expectantly, so Sara continued, "I start. EMIT. Bottom loop. I check to see where we've gone before, and see that we still have to go left. So we walk left. We come across an intersection. I can't re-emit; I've got to keep the original checkpoint. So Maha EMITs. Level 1 loop. Maha checks the map, see that we need to take a right there, so we walk to the right. Now we come to _another_ intersection. We're both tapped out, right?"

"Yeah?"

"No, that was meant to be a leading trick question. Maha can't EMIT; he'd loose the level 1 checkpoint. But I can."

"Wouldn't you lose the bottom checkpoint?"

"That is correct."

"Then how do we get back?"

"The alternation. I EMIT a second time: level 2 loop. But this level 2 loop solely exists in the current iteration of the level 1 loop. Let's say that we explore all the paths in the level 2 intersection. Now, Maha re-EMITs back to the level 1 checkpoint; in doing so, he creates a new, fresh loop - one without me having made the level 2 checkpoint. That means the last checkpoint for my EMITter is actually the bottom loop again."

"That sounds...complicated."

"Thanks. Hey, seriously though; don't start a loop yourself. It is imperative. You'll be our anchor, our only way back to the start. If you make a new start, we've lost that forever."
