# Infinite Heli's at Infinite Typewriters

The button pressed and the door shut, dividing the cats from the mouse.

Heli slid down the cold as Maha and Sara slammed against it, a barrage of fists against the metal barrier. They were too loud, with the knocking and the shouting and the breathing. It just needed to all "STOP!".

And it did. Heli put his head down on his arms on his knees, a shaky breath his only sign of life for a moment. The silence stole the air out of their lungs before it could manifest to sound, and for a moment there was quiet. Peace.

Tentatively, a voice - Maha's - broke the silence "Heli? It can't have been that bad. What did you write down? What did you tell yourself?"

Heli twitched. He splayed his fingers out, flexed them tight again. Then his neck snapped back, slamming the back of his head against the wall. He lowered it again, then WHACK. WHACK. WHACK.

"Heli?" concerned. "Heli!" frightened. "Stop!" pleaded.

Heli spun around on the ground and screamed through the door. They had all been yelled at before, but this was more than any one man could feel. This cry was agony. This shout was pain.

"How can you know how bad it was?"

"What?"

"How could you possibly know? You woke up five minutes ago. Your capacity to understand pain and pure agony is nothing. Nothing! Forgetting the pain doesn't make it go away; it just hides it, builds it, compounding into a broken promise of closure.
"Do you wanna know what I saw? I saw myself die a million times. No - I felt myself die a million times, each time learning something and inevitably falling to something worse. Each death fought for. Each death remembered. And I remember that you did this to me."

"Me?" Cried Maja.

"No - her. Sara, you manipulative bastard. Every loop, you were in charge; you persisted and you maintained and you learned and you treated me like a fucking space probe; a disposable information gatherer with infinite uses. We need to determine the optimal time to jump through the rocket jet flames? Toss Heli in, and if he get's it wrong we'll try again. I was helping, then I was hurting, and you wouldn't let me go. I killed myself a few times for good measure, and you always reset, re-emitted. You couldn't stand not being the hero, so you couldn't let me stay gone. Instead, I had to suffer more pain than any other human being in existence."

silence.

"Why couldn't you have just let me go?"

silence.

"Forgiveness is intolerable to those who weild it most."
