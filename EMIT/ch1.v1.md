## Version 1 (old, WIP)

Three hands pressed into the emission docks; two more held Memori pens against their tablets, writing or about to be; the last absorbed a pistol's recoil as the shot enveloped the room. This has all happened before. This will happen again.

The grip on the gun loosens as the holder realizes the tool he has, tightens when he questions his own intentions from just a second ago. He switches to a more comfortable grip with both hands, aim still locked on the victim. Head swivels to scan behind him.

The bullet misses and embeds into wall panel. The victim's eyes snap-focus to the muzzle flare, follows as the barrel lands squarely at his chest, shuts hard in anticipation. The delay catches him off guard. Day-old sweat renewed, he opens his eyes and slowly raises his hands, and the pen clatters across the table, tip trailing black loops along the notepads.

The bystander's hands have gripped onto the edge of the console. A pained expression washes over his face. Shaking limbs reconcile years of history in moments; multiple lives flash before their eyes.

Misunderstanding eyes and disregarding ears feed uncomprehending minds until someone - finally - begins to speak.

"Great fucking shot. Next time, take out the window while you're at it." chides the bystander.
"I didn't... I..." Then, as the gunman swivels, he decides "Fine. Probably couldn't have been worth a damn anyways".
"Wait wait WAI-".

Glass implodes.
Air floods out.
Bodies freeze.

A written note to self.
A hand slams against the panel.
