# Scouting

> Time enough to find the truth among nothingness.

"Wait," stopped Sara, "repeat that again."

"What, that I have all 10 of my toes?" laughed Maha, then stifled as he saw the look. Sara's eyes were darting back and forth, mouth agape, and hands hanging at her sides. "Uh, yeah. I have 5 of one hand and 5 on the other. Is that", he asked with a growing confused look on his face, "bad?"

Sara turned and left the room. "No, no, no ..." trailed off as she walked down the chute to the external module.

"Hey!" shouted Maha after her. He turned to Heli; _You have 10 too, right?_

"There's time enough to run before walking," spoke Heli, then started jogging to catch up to Sara, who was rambling to herself as she watched her feet take steps she was less confident in than before. Maha and Heli, not having another alternative, fell into step next their guide.

"Talk to us. We're all you got, right?" Maha consoled, then admitted "At least, you're both all I got right now."

"I have misinformation." Curtly responded Sara. She increased her pace to just shy of scrambling. "No one else has access; why would I have written myself bad notes?" nearing frantic speeds, Heli had to jog to keep up.

"This is because I told you I had -"

Stop. The chasers flew past, spun around. Sara was staring at her hands. "Yes. My notes say 9. You lost a finger in your childhood. Evidently you still have all 10. That means my notes are wrong. I'm wrong." Shaking hands put away, Sara suddenly straightened. "I need to go out."

"Out?"

"Yes. Out." Her sharpening vision scared Heli as she continued, "You have experience in suits. Get me into one."

Heli recovered, then was surprised to not feel too surprised, confirming "I do?"

"Yes. The notes say 24 hours. I don't - can't - trust anything, so I need to confirm. I'm going out. I'm getting the right timing. Then I'll restart."
