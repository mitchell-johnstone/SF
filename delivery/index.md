# delivery
At what point does predictability become predestination?
We will recommend you your next thought, says the brain molecules.

## 4 characters? 4 deliveries?

ti need to just start somewhere, but where?
one on the roof


or all on the console?
remember: don't define needlessly. I need to have the world and describe the world only because of the current effects, not because I need to tell the reader what is going on: they will figure it out

because each is separate, I don't actually need to figure out all: ti can tie them together, or if I don't like one story I can rewrite it into something else, or just delete it entirely

# the delivery
have a kid build a trebuchet
have a plane explosion
have a construction site
have a media crewmember at the crashsite
have a bullet shoot a bulltet
deliver a pen? why not

# board meeting
"The beta test users of the Eres system have shown a 98.8% satisfaction rate. That means that worried parents are better caring for their children, members of the police force have informed and current action plans and assistance, and other fortune 500 companies are kept stocked with the items they need when they need them, and not a moment sooner. It is the opinion of the board that this system be implemented on a larger test site and for a longer time period for further confirmation of the performance, followed by an immediate integration nationwide."
The CTO stopped reading off the memo. Nasty habit to have, especially when all but one of those sitting at the board table had already read and signed the declaration. But formalities were tradition, one that provided the owner ample time to consider.
"What's the current sample size?"
"The capital of South Dakota, Pierre. Thus, serving approximately 13,646 residents."
"And how many deliveries?"
"5,349 successful deliveries, over the course of 5 weeks."
"And the number of unsuccessful?"
"2, each of which were resolved with a follow up delivery."
"And you're sure this system is extensible without an increase in those percentages?"
"We are extremely confident. The failures were committed near the beginning of the implementation, and the cause was corrected and learned from. It currently has a 5,255 success streak."
"I see."
They waited in silence, all of the board members watching, waiting for their work to be questioned, or for a resolution, while the owner leafed through the report. He was similarly waiting for one of them to break, not out of malice but to know what they were thinking. Another tradition.
"Would... you like a demonstration?" asked the CTO.
"I think that'd be appropriate. What kind?"
"Well, we've got the full catalog to use. Our largest order was for 200 lbs, though we're cabale of much more."
"There's no need to go that big. Besides, if I'm understanding the system correctly, then it's more about the time of the delivery rather than the size. Yes?"
"Absolutely. The true innovation does come from the temporal aspects."
"Alright then. Let's go off tradition; back when I was first starting this business there was a classic challenge that managers would give their sales associates. Would anyone like to venture a guess?"
"Was it ''"
