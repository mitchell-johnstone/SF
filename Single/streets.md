# Streets

## Guiding Idea

## My Experience
On May 29th, 2024, I walked around Milwaukee for the first time in a long time.
And really walked. Not a casual stroll with friends, paying more attention to them than the buildings and streets.
I saw the city. What it was becoming. What I've lost.

Back as a freshman in college, I was just beginning to stretch and test my independence.
I made some stupid choices, as all young kids do. I ignored people's warnings about the city.
And I think my life has been all the better for it.

Whispers of the world across the river made it's way through the school, and it felt like everyone
was scared to venture the 2 blocks to see for themselves. They were comfortable in their 2 block radius.
But I wanted to know. So I walked a lot of nights, far and wide, testing the boundaries of my world.

I've had plenty of interactions with homeless people here in MKE, stretching from asking for money
to offering weed to just saying hello after I disturbed their sleep.
Hell, a few have even cracked jokes with me or told me poems.
I know nothing of their world, and yet I know that the others around me know even less.
Is it their lack of experience that scares them? Or the stereotype? How have we lost empathy for them?

I've gone many places I probably shouldn't have.
A few roofs visited, gates slid past, ladders shakingly clung to.
I know what lies beneath the bridges over the water.
I know to slink past barbed wire guarding the top of a ladder.
I know how a gunshot echoes in a quiet neighborhood.

And I have a lot of small treasures from my meanderings.
A hatchet, a crowbar, some boggle dice, a drill set.
I have many fun (or dangerous) stories to tell.

Some nights are uneventful, but peaceful. Others are constant action without rest.
All are worth remembering.

but what I've always loved was the feeling of knowing the city. Of being a part of it.
There's a sort of intimacy that comes from knowing every crook and cranny of a place.
Not the surface level shit they spout on tours, but the gritty details.
And I take pride in knowing those details, in being able to tell them and show people a glimpse of what they're missing.


But this city is being taken away from me. I'm losing it, bit by bit. So slow that I don't know what I've lost until it's already gone.

Across the street from the Best Place Coffee and Spirits, there lies a parking structure akin to all others of it's kind.
What makes this place special is how stunning the city looks from the top floor. It all stretches out ahead of you,
And you can almost feel the lights of the buildings pierce through the dark sky and graze your soul.
I went there a few times alone to selfishly bask in the brilliance.
I took a few friends there to show them the view if only they walked a bit further.
Some of my favorite photos are taken on that roof, of the city and of us being moved by it.

I felt like I could take recluse in it, in knowing that the view would be there for me if I looked for it.
I don't think I've gone to that building for close to a year now.
But last night I craved the city; I needed to feel like I could stake a claim to some piece or some view.
I wanted a place to sit and read, tucked away into my private city in the city.
I walked across the river, where dirt bike gangs ride on sidewalks and everyone takes their own journey.
I walked past the glass monolith of the Fiserv Forum, so transparent and yet impassable.
I debated going that far. I could stop at a hotel lobby, or find a nice streetlamp.
But I wanted the lights of the city to sparkle, to make my heart breathe.
And it was closed off. "Permit Parking Only".
The entrance was gated, with a security guard ever present in his squad car.
Each level had 10 foot tall fences. All doors were locked.
I promise, I checked.

I know that if I go back there I'll likely be tossed out or worse.
But it just feels like that part of the city that was so beautiful to me has been stolen.
And I desperately want it back.


The same thing happened with the courthouse that same night.
There's just something incredibly ironic about seeing a statue of Ghandi restricted behind gates.

It's always been an odd spot in my mind.
The plaza connects the courthouse, the police headquarters, the public safety building, the public museum.
And it's always ever been a safe haven for the homeless or completely shut off to everyone.
I've never seen anyone else there. Which is a shame. The city is almost as pretty from that park.
Last night when I went, I wanted my runner up for views of the city skyline.
And again I was completely shut off.
No matter the entrance to the park, a wire fence was put up to stop entry.
UV lights shined against the courthouse, making it unnatural and illuminating anyone, black or white, who stepped within its spotlight.
No tents are allowed to be set up. People have resorted to sleeping on the windowsills.

How is this public?


I'm being thrown out of my city without an eviction notice.
The places and spaces are being taken away.
I'm losing it all.

It feels like there's a select set of things that people are meant to do at night in MKE:
- Get drunk,
- Eat food truck morsels,
- Drink some more,
- Maybe watch a sports game,
- Walk home drunk.
And if you don't fit into that, then you're shit out of luck.
In fact, you're being actively plotted against.

You want to see the city at night? Gonna have to break the law for a decent view.
Need a bench to sleep on? Hope the uncomfortably jarring peice of wood doesn't keep you up.
You want the city? Stick to the streets, bastard.

It's a modern 1984, but even worse because no one else sees it; they're all having fun.
All the while the city is closing the doors of its beauty.





### Other thoughts
It's odd that architecture is moving to become so much more transparent,
and yet it feels like it's a facade; no one is allowed in, but everyone is allowed to see.
